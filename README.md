## Must Read

- *READ VERY CAREFULLY* this section.

### Grading

Look at first day part of [lecture slide](lecture.pdf).

### Questions

- Ask questions in the [GitHub repository issue tracker](https://github.com/snu-sf-class/pp201602/issues).
- Send email for *PERSONAL MATTERS ONLY*.
- If you want to post a piece of source code, please DO NOT upload an image of it. Because it is hard to parse images.
    + Instead, use GitHub Markdown's ["fenced code blocks" feature](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks).
    + Or, you can always use [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/).

### Scala

- We will use tools with latest stable version.
- Use Scala [2.11.8](http://scala-lang.org/download/).  *DO NOT* use other versions.
- Use Sbt [0.13.12](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html). *DO NOT* use other versions.
    + If not, your submissions (assignments & exams) will not be properly graded.

- Use IDEs supporting Scala.
    + Emacs: [Ensime](https://github.com/ensime).
    + Eclipse, IntelliJj IDEA: I haven't used it, but you may easily find information on google.

- Etc.
    + Coursera course's [tool setting](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/home/week/1).

### Assignment

- Assignments will be issued every Wednesday.  The deadline is the next Sunday (10 days later).  The deadline for the delayed submission is the next to the next Sunday (17 days later).

#### Honor Code: *DO NOT CHEAT*

- If you copy others' source code, you will get F.
- "Others' source code" includes other students' and resources around the web. Especially, do not consult with public repositories on software foundations.
- Note that we have a good automatic clone detector. We found out that a lot of students cheated last time. We hope we all be happy at the end of the semester..
- The maximum score of a delayed submission is 80% that of a regular submission.
    + The granularity the delayed submission is per-problem, not per-assignment. So even if you couldn't get the full score for the regular submission period, try to solve the remaining problems and submit them.

#### Submission

TBA
